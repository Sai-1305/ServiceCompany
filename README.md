    Able to add the tasks, and monitor them.

  <li>They helped each and everyone of our team to collaborate with others remotely and explain the issues in a procedural way.</li>
  <li>It helped us to track the progress of the tasks or bugs.</li>
  <li>It was easy to visualize the works and identify which areas are faulty.</li>

## 3. Possible applications

Our future projects like GDP-1 and GDP-2 are also application building projects. Using project boards, we can list all the tasks and developments in one place professionally, assign the tasks to the concerned persons and then monitor the progress of the tasks with ease. This helps in planning our activities on a daily basis and work on the specific tasks and then go to the next task without hassle.
