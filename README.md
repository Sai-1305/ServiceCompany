## 3. Possible applications

Our future projects like GDP-1 and GDP-2 are also application building projects. Using project boards, we can list all the tasks and developments in one place professionally, assign the tasks to the concerned persons and then monitor the progress of the tasks with ease. This helps in planning our activities on a daily basis and work on the specific tasks and then go to the next task without hassle.
